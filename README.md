## Description

Robust object manipulation is essential for robotics applications in real-world environments, especially when handling diverse and complex everyday objects. To facilitate this research, we present HILO, a large-scale dataset of 253 real-world everyday objects and 288 diverse scenes. HILO bridges a crucial gap in existing manipulation datasets through its heterogeneity and dual-resolution approach, combining high-resolution individual object scans with low-resolution scans of cluttered scenes. This provides both the precise geometric data needed for grasp planning and realistic environmental context. The dataset's comprehensive representations enable rigorous benchmarking of robotic grasping algorithms. Our evaluation of three leading grasping algorithms—Contact-GraspNet, GraspNet Baseline, and DexNet 4.0—reveals critical trade-offs between grasp quantity and quality, demonstrating the dataset's value in advancing robotic grasping research. HILO's rich object diversity and dual-resolution methodology provide a foundation for developing more versatile robotic systems capable of reliable real-world robotic manipulation.
